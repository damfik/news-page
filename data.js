Sofia looked incredible in the photo, showing off an impressive post-baby body merely one day after giving birth. The royal wore a white top, grey jacket and casual jeans. Last summer, Sofia spoke about the joys of motherhood, telling Sweden's Svenskdam: \"It's amazing. Having children changes your whole life.\" She also noted, \"[Alexander] is very sweet and well-behaved.\" Carl Philip also discussed his new role as a father, telling the outlet that it took \"some adjustment, of course, but it is still absolutely amazing and wonderful\".",
